The Food Ordering Application is a Windows desktop application built with C# and .NET (Windows Forms). The system simulates a real-world restaurant ordering process where customers can select food items from a menu, specify quantities, and place orders through an intuitive graphical interface.

The application focuses on user-friendly design, event-driven programming, and proper handling of calculations such as item totals, taxes (if applied), and final billing. It demonstrates strong understanding of GUI development concepts in C#, including forms, buttons, labels, textboxes, combo boxes, list views, and event handling.

This project is ideal for learning desktop application development and understanding how front-end logic connects with backend processing in a standalone environment.
